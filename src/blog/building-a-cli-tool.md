## Introduction

Have you ever felt the hassle of repeatedly selecting options from Inquirer while setting up a new project? Thatâ€™s precisely what inspired me to build a CLI tool that helps scaffold boilerplate templates effortlessly.

It all started with a CLI tool I built for a project at work. After that experience, I decided to spend my weekend creating something personalâ€”a CLI tool to automate project scaffolding and save time. This blog post delves into the journey of building my first CLI, the challenges I faced, the features I added, and plans for the future.

## Why Build a CLI Tool?

When building projects, I found myself wasting valuable time repeatedly setting up project folders, installing dependencies, and selecting options through the terminal. Although tools like Create React App exist, I wanted something personalizedâ€”something that supported the frameworks I work with most: **React**, **Next.js**, **Svelte**, and custom HTML templates.

So, I set out to solve this problem by creating a CLI tool to:

1. Automate scaffolding project structures.
2. Minimize repetitive tasks.
3. Allow for customization of templates.
4. Support versioning and easy distribution via npm.

## The Learning Process

Building a CLI tool was a first for me. While working on the CLI tool for a work project, I spent a lot of time reading articles, experimenting, and debugging. That knowledge became the foundation for this personal project.

Some key steps in the learning process were:

- **Understanding Node.js and Commander.js**: I chose Commander.js for building the CLI due to its simplicity and robust feature set.
- **Integrating Inquirer.js**: This library made it easy to add interactive prompts for user input.
- **Publishing to npm**: I learned how to package the tool and automate versioning with GitHub Actions.

Hereâ€™s what the initial folder structure of my CLI project looked like:

```plaintext
my-cli/
â”œâ”€â”€ bin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reactjs-template/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nextjs-template/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ svelte-template/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom-template/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Features of the CLI Tool

### 1. Template Scaffolding

The CLI supports scaffolding templates for the following frameworks:

- **Reactjs**
- **Nextjs**
- **Sveltejs**
- **Custom templates** (e.g., basic HTML or any boilerplate you prefer)

With a single command, I can scaffold a project folder with a predefined structure, install dependencies, and get started immediately.

### 2. Customizable Options

To reduce repetitive terminal prompts, I added options for directly specifying the template and project name. For example:

```bash
cli-starter-template my-project --template react
```

### Streamlined Project Setup

This eliminates the need for multiple Inquirer.js prompts, speeding up the setup process.

### 3. GitHub Workflow Integration

One of the coolest features I implemented was versioning and publishing automation. With every new release, a GitHub Workflow automatically builds and publishes the package to npm. This feature ensures smooth updates and consistent version control.

## Insights from the Experience

### Challenges

- **First-Time CLI Development**: Navigating the nuances of building a CLI from scratch was challenging but rewarding.
- **Publishing to npm**: Ensuring the package was ready for the public involved writing detailed documentation and following npm guidelines.

### Wins

- **Quick Adoption**: Less than a day after publishing to npm, the package had over 100 installs! Seeing people use the tool was incredibly fulfilling.
- **Improved Productivity**: It has already saved me hours of setup time for new projects.

## Future Plans

Although the CLI tool is functional, thereâ€™s plenty of room for improvement and new features. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s next on my roadmap:

- **Integrate shadcn Components**: Preconfigure design components for a consistent UI across projects.
- **Add Supabase Support**: Include boilerplate configurations for authentication and database functionality.
- **Support More Frameworks**: Expand the list of templates to include popular frameworks like Vue.js, Astro, and more.
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback to improve usability and add features requested by developers.

## Conclusion

Building this CLI tool was an exciting journey that improved both my technical skills and my workflow. Whether you're a developer who frequently starts new projects or someone who loves automation, creating a CLI tool can be a rewarding experience.

If youâ€™d like to try it out or contribute to the project, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chifez/cli-template-starter) and the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-template-starter).

Thank you for reading, and I hope this inspires you to build something that solves your own problems. ðŸš€
